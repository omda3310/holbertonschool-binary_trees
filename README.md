Introduction
A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes, where each node can have at most two children. The topmost node is called the root, and each node can have a left child and a right child. Binary Trees are commonly used in computer science for efficient storage and retrieval of data.

This project provides a comprehensive implementation of a Binary Tree, including basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

Features
Creation of a Binary Tree with custom nodes
Insertion of nodes into the Binary Tree
Deletion of nodes from the Binary Tree
Searching for a specific value in the Binary Tree
Traversal of the Binary Tree in different orders (pre-order, in-order, post-order)
Height calculation of the Binary Tree
Counting the number of nodes in the Binary Tree
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-tree-project.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd binary-tree-project
Install any necessary dependencies:
npm install
Usage
Import the Binary Tree module into your project:
const BinaryTree = require('binary-tree');
Create a new instance of the Binary Tree:
const binaryTree = new BinaryTree();
Perform various operations on the Binary Tree. Here are a few examples:
// Insertion
binaryTree.insert(10);
binaryTree.insert(5);
binaryTree.insert(15);

// Traversal
binaryTree.preOrderTraversal();
binaryTree.inOrderTraversal();
binaryTree.postOrderTraversal();

// Searching
const foundNode = binaryTree.search(5);
console.log(foundNode);

// Deletion
binaryTree.delete(10);
Explore the API documentation and examples in the docs directory for more details on available methods and their usage.
